      <h1>Hi, I'm Nikki</h1>
      <p>Junior web and mobile developer at Epicodus with experience working both independently and collaboratively in an agile, pair programming environment.</p>

    <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        After finding my purpose in software development, I knew I had to turn my passion into a career. I was first introduced to coding while earning my B.S. in GIS; I loved developing interactive web maps and prioritizing the user experience. Upon graduation from PSU, I decided to begin my coding journey at Epicodus and further my education in software development.
        <br><br>
        Throughout my projects, Iâ€™ve discovered that coding has become the perfect medium for me to fuel my desire to solve problems. I genuinely enjoy the process of creating thoughtful solutions and intuitive designs in all of my work.
        <br><br>
        I'm looking forward to bringing my talent and enthusiasm for software development in a role with a company that offers exciting challenges, values strong work ethic, and has opportunity for me to continue my growth as a developer.

            For this project, we were challenged to create an exact replica of Wikipedia's homepage. Some new features I learned during this project include: grids, box model, media queries, and CSS styling. During our peer review, our cohort seemed very impressed with how much we were able to get done in just 4 hours.
